In this project, we successfully created a simple chatbot using a traditional rule-based approach. The development process demonstrated the chatbot's complete lifecycle, from requirements analysis and design through implementation, testing, and deployment. By setting up the environment, running the EchoBot Sample, and modifying the code, we learned how to create an interactive chatbot and test it locally. This hands-on experience highlights the foundational principles of chatbot development, a core step in building more advanced AI-powered systems. Overall, this project demonstrates how structured logic can enable effective interaction between humans and computers.
